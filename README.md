# ArmstrongValueChecker
This program checks to see if a provided Integer is a an Armstrong Number

Mersk-Challenge-number 5
## Project Brief
A number is called an Armstrong number if it is equal to the cube of its every digit. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because of 153= 1+ 125+27, which is equal to 1^3+5^3+3^3. You need to write a program to check if the given number is Armstrong number or not.

Please write the unit tests for your solution using any of the unit testing framework.
## Dependencies used
* JUnit 5.6.0 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api

### How To Run
1. Run Main.java  within the src file with the main() method

### Highlights
1. Works efficiently
2. The checker still works regardless of large numbers
3. The method is efficient
4. Single values work

### Improvements
1. Integer data type applies constraints to the size of the value. This could be changed to a Long.
